#### #1) Empty File Folder Remover
  #### Problem:
        When I plug my Memory Card to My System, I Found lots of EMPTY Files and Folders (Created Since I installed
many apps on android and Uninstall them later on). I want to remove all the empty folder and files(Most of the Files
that i no longer need are in the range of 0-100 Bytes - But i may have some notes with smaller size too).

        I have written a script that loop through the Drive/directory infinitely and delete all files and folders 
until I found no files and folders to delete.
  #### ISSUE:
#1) It can't identify the notes that i may have with less than 100 Bytes, and delete all the files with less than 100 Bytes.
